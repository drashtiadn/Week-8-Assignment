# Week-8-Assignment: Unsupervised Learning - Association Rule Learning


Exercise 1: Market Basket Analysis

Consider that you are a data analyst at a grocery store, and the store manager wants to understand 
the buying habits of the customers to arrange the layout of the store accordingly. Use the "Grocery 
Store Dataset" from the UCI repository (https://www.kaggle.com/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset) to 
discover interesting associations.


Exercise 2: Movie Recommendations

Assume you are a data scientist at a movie streaming service and you want to recommend movies to 
users based on the movies that they have already watched. You can use the "MovieLens dataset" 
(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for this exercise.
